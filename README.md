### Manage medical instrument related tasks in Hospitals

SIEMS is designed for Hospitals to manage the Surgical Instruments and Equipment. Until now, most of the Hospitals use manual inventory systems but it is difficult to maintain. The authorised users of this desktop application is the surgical pharmacists, who have the privileges to maintain, modify the system, because they are the once who are responsible for all the procedures related with surgical instruments and equipment. Additionally, this system provides ability to any other user, staff to view the system and find certain instrument or equipment, especially staff from wards, clinics and ICUs.
